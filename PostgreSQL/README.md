# Overview
Hi, this is my folder of PostgreSQL database in my project of leanring database.
This folder is just about the basics of database like CRUD operations, transactions and then come to some more advanced operations like RULEs, stored procedures, searching, ...
Besides database operation, I tried to create a simple app by Go Lang connected with PostgreSQL. My purpose of small app was to learn how to use driver, how to connect to database, how to query. 
I have tried to perform Transaction which is a bit more advanced than CRUD operations. 
I create my own stored procedures for some function like suggesting movies or actors. 

# What I learned in this folder
- Go Lang
    - Database Driver: pgx
    - How to code with Go Lang
    - Functional programming

    - CRUD operations

    - Transactions

    - Text searching: Strictly matching, fuzzy searching
